# Weather-Dashboard
This is a simple program that allows the user to look up the weather information for any location that they search for. Once the location is pulled up, the user will be able to see the 5-day forecast and the humidity for that specific location. Once the user has looked up a location, that specific location will be saved into their search history

# USER STORY
